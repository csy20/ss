🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING STEPS:

1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → sitasonii project
2. Check "Settings" → "Environment Variables"
3. Verify these are set correctly:
   ✓ MONGODB_URI (with REAL password, not "YOUR_PASSWORD")
   ✓ NEXTAUTH_URL (https://sitasonii-6bj3pj078-csys-projects-68441e72.vercel.app)
   ✓ NEXTAUTH_SECRET (random string)
   ✓ ADMIN_EMAIL (jageshwarsahu910@gmail.com)
   ✓ ADMIN_PASSWORD (Jaggu@06)
   ✓ NODE_ENV (production)

4. If any are wrong, edit them
5. Go to "Deployments" tab
6. Click "Redeploy"

🤔 COMMON ISSUES:
- MongoDB password still has placeholder
- NEXTAUTH_SECRET not set or set to wrong value
- Missing environment variables

💡 NEXT STEPS:
1. Check the exact error in Vercel dashboard
2. Fix any incorrect environment variables
3. Redeploy

🎯 YOU'RE VERY CLOSE! Just need to fix the environment variables correctly.
